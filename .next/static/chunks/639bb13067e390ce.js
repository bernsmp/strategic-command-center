Jay asked one question: "What happens to your trucks on weekends?"

His solution was simple. Hire two kids to drive the trucks on weekends to shopping centers, beaches—anywhere with high foot traffic. Cost: $1,200 for a weekend. Profit on one roofing job: $15,000.

Before they even implemented the full strategy, a single truck parked at a restaurant caught an HOA board member's eye.

3. **Identify my blind spots** - What have I stopped seeing because it's "just how we do things"?

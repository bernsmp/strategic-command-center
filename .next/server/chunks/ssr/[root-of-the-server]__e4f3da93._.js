Jay asked one question: "What happens to your trucks on weekends?"

His solution was simple. Hire two kids to drive the trucks on weekends to shopping centers, beaches—anywhere with high foot traffic. Cost: $1,200 for a weekend. Profit on one roofing job: $15,000.

Before they even implemented the full strategy, a single truck parked at a restaurant caught an HOA board member's eye.

He called that afternoon. One million dollar HOA contract.`,lesson:"Thirty years in business. Ten thousand times walking past those trucks without seeing them.

I'm going to describe my business. Your job is NOT to solve my stated problems. Your job is to:

1. **Question my assumptions** - What am I treating as fixed that might be flexible?
2. **Find my hidden assets** - What do I own, control, or have access to that I'm not leveraging?
3. **Identify my blind spots** - What have I stopped seeing because it's "just how we do things"?

Ask me the questions Jay would ask. The ones that make me pause. The ones I haven't been asked before.

After I describe my business, start with ONE powerful question—the kind that makes the room go quiet.
